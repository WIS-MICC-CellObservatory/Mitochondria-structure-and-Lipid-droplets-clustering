# Mitochondria-structure-and-Lipid-droplets-clustering
We use FIji, Stardist Cellpose and Ilastik to identify the structure of the mitochondria and the lipid droplets clustering in cells under starvation
## Overview
Given an image with three channels: Lipid Droplets (LDs), Litosomes, and Mitocondria stainings we do the following:
1. Use Stardist or Cellpose to identify the LDs
2. Use Fiji's SSIDC plugin to find LDs clustering
3. Use Cellpose to idenitify cells
4. Use Ilastik to identify the mitochondria
5. Use Excel to categorize cells according to the LDs clustering and the size of the mitochondria
